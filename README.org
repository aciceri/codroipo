* Codroipo

~codroipo~ is my personalized [[https://github.com/beekeeb/Allium58][Allium58]].
Basically I simply removed the OLED display and everything related to wired build, sligthly moved some components and added some cosmetics.

** Build the firmware

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix build github:aciceri/codroipo#firmware
#+END_SRC

** Flash the firmware

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
nix run github:aciceri/codroipo#flash
#+END_SRC
